### Project 1
```
Perform the following query scenarios using the dvdrental sample database.

  - Sort the data in the title and description columns of the film table.
  - Sort the data in all columns in the film table, with the film length being greater than 60 AND less than 75.
  - Sort the data in all columns in the film table as rental_rate 0.99 AND replacement_cost 12.99 OR 28.99.
  - What is the value in the last_name column of the customer whose value is 'Mary' in the first_name column in the customer table?
  - Sort the data in the film table whose length is NOT greater than 50 and whose rental_rate value is NOT 2.99 or 4.99.
```

### Project 2
```
Perform the following query scenarios using the dvdrental sample database.

  - Sort the data in all columns in the film table, provided that the replacement cost value is greater than or equal to 12.99 and less than 16.99 (use the BETWEEN - AND structure).
  - Sort the data in the first_name and last_name columns in the actor table, provided that first_name has the values 'Penelope' or 'Nick' or 'Ed'. (Use the IN operator.)
  - Sort the data in all columns in the film table as rental_rate 0.99, 2.99, 4.99 AND replacement_cost 12.99, 15.99, 28.99. (Use the IN operator.)
```

### Project 3
```

```

### Project 4
```
Perform the following query scenarios using the dvdrental sample database.

  - List the different values in the replacement_cost column in the film table.
  - How many different data are there in the replacement_cost column in the film table?
  - How many of the film titles in the film table start with the character T and also have a rating equal to 'G'?
  - How many of the country names in the country table consist of 5 characters?

   - List the 5 films (6,7,8,9,10) that are the second shortest in length (6,7,8,9,10) in the film table and whose film title ends with the character 'n'.
   - Sort the first 4 data in descending order according to the last_name column in the customer table, provided that store_id is 1.
```

### Project 6
```
Perform the following query scenarios using the dvdrental sample database.

   - What is the average of the values in the rental_rate column in the film table?
   - How many of the films in the film table start with the character 'C'?
   - Among the films in the film table, how many minutes is the longest film with a rental_rate value equal to 0.99?
   - How many different replacement_cost values are there for the films in the film table that are longer than 150 minutes?
```

### Project 7
```
Perform the following query scenarios using the dvdrental sample database.

   - Group the films in the film table according to their rating values.
   - When we group the films in the film table according to the replacement_cost column, list the replacement_cost value and the corresponding number of films if the number of films is more than 50.
   - What are the customer numbers corresponding to the store_id values in the customer table?
   - After grouping the city data in the city table according to the country_id column, share the country_id information and the number of cities that contain the highest number of cities.
```

### Project 8
```
  - Let's create a table named employee in your test database with column information id(INTEGER), name VARCHAR(50), birthday DATE, email VARCHAR(100).
  - Let's add 50 data to the employee table we created using the 'Mockaroo' service.
  - Let's perform 5 UPDATE operations that will update the other columns according to each column.
